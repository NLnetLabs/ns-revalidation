	This document recommends improved DNS resolver behavior with
	respect to the processing of NS record sets during iterative
	resolution. The first recommendation is that resolvers, when
	following a referral response from an authoritative server to
	a child zone, should explicitly query the authoritative NS RRset
	at the apex of the child zone and cache this in preference to
	the NS RRset on the parent side of the zone cut. The second
	recommendation is to revalidate the delegation by re-quering
	the parent zone at the expiration of the TTL of the parent side
	NS RRset.

    <section anchor="motivation" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Motivation</name>
      <t>
        There is wide variability in the behavior of deployed DNS resolvers
        today with respect to how they process delegation records. Some of
        them prefer the parent NS set, some prefer the child, and for others,
        what they preferentially cache depends on the dynamic state of
        queries and responses they have processed. This document aims to
        bring more commonality and predictability by standardizing the
        behavior in a way that comports with the DNS protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
	The delegation NS RRset at the bottom of the parent zone and the
	apex NS RRset in the child zone are unsynchronized in the DNS
	protocol. <xref target="RFC1034" format="default"/> Section 4.2.2 says
	"The administrators of both zones should insure that the NS and
	glue RRs which mark both sides of the cut are consistent and remain
	so.". But for a variety of
	reasons they could not be. Officially, a child zone's apex NS RRset
	is authoritative and thus has a higher cache credibility than the
	parent's delegation NS RRset, which is non-authoritative glue
	(<xref target="RFC2181" format="default"/>, Section 5.4.1. "Ranking
        data", and Section 6.1. "Zone authority"). Hence the
	NS RRset "below the zone cut" should immediately replace the parent's
	delegating NS RRset in cache when an iterative caching DNS resolver
	crosses a zone boundary. However, this can only happen if (1) the
	resolver receives the authoritative NS RRset in the Authority section
	of a response from the child zone, which is not mandatory, or (2) if
	the resolver explicitly issues an NS RRset query to the child zone as
	part of its iterative resolution algorithm. In the absence of this,
	it is possible for an iterative caching resolver to never learn the
	authoritative NS RRset for a zone, unless a downstream client of the
	resolver explicitly issues such an NS query, which is not something
	that normal enduser applications do, and thus cannot be relied upon
        to occur with any regularity.
      </t>
      <t>
	Increasingly, there is a trend towards minimizing unnecessary data
	in DNS responses. Several popular DNS implementations default to such
	a configuration (see "minimal-responses" in BIND and Unbound). So,
        they may never include the authoritative NS RRset in the Authority
        section of their responses.
      </t>
      <t>
	A common reason that zone owners want to ensure that resolvers
	place the authoritative NS RRset preferentially in their cache is
	that the TTLs may differ between the parent and child side of the
	zone cut. Some DNS Top Level Domains (TLDs) only support long fixed
	TTLs in their delegation NS sets. In fact, the
        <xref target="RFC5731" format="default">Extensible Provisioning
        Protocol (EPP)</xref>, that is often used by TLDs to configure
        delegation parameters has no provision to set the TTL. This inhibits
        a child zone owner's ability to make more rapid changes to their
        nameserver configuration using a shorter TTL, if resolvers have no
        systematic mechanism to observe and cache the child NS RRset.
      </t>
      <t>
	A child zone's delegation still needs to be periodically
	revalidated at the parent to make sure that the parent zone
	has not legitimately re-delegated the zone to a different set
	of nameservers, or even removed the delegation. Otherwise, resolvers
        that refresh the TTL of a child NS RRset on subsequent queries or
        due to pre-fetching, may cling to those nameservers long after they
        have been re-delegated elsewhere. This leads to the second
        recommendation in this document, "Delegation Revalidation" - Resolvers
        should record the TTL of the parent's delegating NS RRset, and use it
        to trigger a revalidation action.

      <ul spacing="normal">
	<li>
	   When a delegation response is received during iteration, a
	   validation query should be sent in parallel with the resolution of
	   the triggering query, to the delegated nameservers for the newly
	   discovered zone cut. Note that validating resolvers today,
	   when following a secure referral, already need to dispatch a query
           to the delegated nameservers for the DNSKEY RRset, so this validation
           query could be sent in parallel with that DNSKEY query.
	</li>
        <li>
	   A validation query consists of a query for the child's apex NS
	   RRset, sent to the newly discovered delegation's nameservers. Normal
	   iterative logic applies to the processing of responses to validation
	   queries, including storing the results in cache, trying the next
	   server on SERVFAIL or timeout, and so on. Positive answers to this
	   validation query will be cached with an authoritative data ranking.
	   Successive queries directed to the same zone will be directed to the
	   nameservers listed in the child's apex, due to the ranking of this
	   answer. If the validation query fails, the parent NS RRset will remain
	   the one with the highest ranking and will be used for successive
	   queries.
	</li>
        <!-- Ralph: fwiw, I'm ok with completely dropping the next items. Let's
	     keep this simple. -->

	<li>
	   Some resolvers may choose to delay the response to the triggering
           query until both the triggering query and the validation query have
           been answered. In practice, we expect many implementations may
           answer the triggering query in advance of the validation query for
           performance reasons. An additional reason is that there are number
           of nameservers in the field that (incorrectly) fail to answer explicit
           queries for NS records, and thus the revalidation logic may need to
           be applied lazily and opportunistically to deal with them.
	</li>
        <li>
	   If the resolver chooses to delay the response, and there are no
	   nameserver names in common between the child's apex NS RRset and the
	   parent's delegation NS RRset, then the responses received from
	   forwarding the triggering query to the parent's delegated nameservers
	   should be discarded after validation, and this query should be
	   forwarded again to the child's apex nameservers.
	</li>
      </ul>

    <section anchor="revalidation" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Delegation Revalidation</name>
      <t>
        This documents proposes two mechanisms to perform delegation
	revalidation: an extensive and a simple mechanism. [TODO: should
        we keep just the simple mechanism?]
      </t>
      <t>The extensive mechanism:

      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
	   The lowest TTL found in a parent zone's delegating NS RRset
	   should be stored in the cache and used to trigger delegation
	   revalidation as follows: Whenever a cached RRset is being considered
	   for use in a response, the cache should be walked upward toward the
	   root, looking for expired delegations. At the first expired
	   delegation encountered while walking upward toward the root,
	   revalidation should be triggered, putting the processing of dependent
	   queries on hold until validation is complete.
	</li>
        <li>
	   To revalidate a delegation, the iterative caching DNS resolver
	   will redo resolution of the triggering query at the closest
           enclosing zone cut above the revalidation point. If
           <xref target="RFC7816" format="default">Query-name Minimization
           </xref> is being employed, this may not be the full name of the
           triggering query, but the query name with some number of left
           most labels excised as dictated by the qname minimization
           algorithm.  While
	   searching for these nameservers, additional revalidations may occur,
	   perhaps placing a chain of dependent queries on hold, unwinding in
	   downward order as revalidations closer to the root must be complete
	   before revalidations further from the root can begin.
	</li>
        <li>
	   If a delegation can be revalidated at the same node, then the
	   old apex NS RRset should be deleted from cache and then the new
	   delegating NS RRset should be stored in cache. The minimum TTL from
	   the new delegating NS RRset should also be stored in cache to
	   facilitate future revalidations. This order of operations ensures
	   that the RRset credibility rules do not prevent the new delegating NS
	   RRset from entering the cache. It is expected that the child's apex
	   NS RRset will rapidly replace the parent's delegating NS RRset as
	   soon as iteration restarts after the revalidation event.
	</li>
        <li>
	   If the new delegating NS RRset cannot be found (RCODE=NXDOMAIN)
	   or if there is a new zone cut at some different level of the
	   hierarchy (insertion or deletion of a delegation point above the
	   revalidation point) or if the new RRset shares no nameserver names in
	   common with the old one (indicating some kind of redelegation, which
	   is rare) then the cache should be purged of all names and RRsets at
	   or below the revalidation point. This facilitates redelegation or
	   revocation of a zone by a parent zone administrator, and also
	   conserves cache storage by deleting unreachable data.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <t>

      The simple mechanism:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
	   Cap the time to cache the child NS RRset to the lower of child
           and parent NS RRset TTL. The normal iterative resolution algorithm
           will then cause delegation revalidation to naturally occur at the
           expiration of the capped child NS TTL, along with dispatching of
           the validation query to upgrade NS RRset credibility.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <section anchor="UsingDS" toc="default">
        <name>Using the DS Record TTL</name>
        <t>
	  If both parent and child zone are DNSSEC
          <xref target="RFC4033" format="default"/>
          <xref target="RFC4034" format="default"/>
          <xref target="RFC4035" format="default"/> signed with a
	  corresponding secure delegation between them, then expiration
	  of the Delegation Signer (DS) record set will cause revalidation of
	  the current child zone's DNSKEY set. According to RFC 4035, Section
	  2.4, "The TTL of a DS RRSet SHOULD match the TTL of the delegating
	  NS RRset", so this revalidation should be triggered on the same
	  time scale, and thus responses from the stale child nameservers
	  would no longer be trusted. However, delegation revalidation is
	  still necessary to locate the current nameserver addresses to which
	  subsequent DNS queries should be directed.
        </t>
        <t>
          In practice, the DS
          TTL often differs from the delegating NS TTL. For example,
          currently the root zone and the COM and NET TLDs all set an
          NS RRset TTL of 2 days, while the DS RRset TTL is just 1 day.
          <xref target="rssac-003" format="default">RSSAC-003</xref>
          makes the following observation:
          "In the root zone, delegating NS records have a 2 day TTL. However,
          the DS records have a 1 day TTL, against the advice of RFC 4035.
          This is not particularly surprising since a mistake with a DS record
          can deny resolution for all names under a TLD. Given the way that DS
          records are currently used in the root zone (e.g., usually matching
          just one TLD KSK) it is better for them to have a lower TTL in the
          event of an emergency change."
        </t>
        <t>
          If a secure delegation is present, resolvers may use the
          DS RRset's TTL as the revalidation interval in preference to
          to the delegating NS RRSet TTL. (Question: should this be the
          recommendation instead?; after all the DS is signed so its TTL cannot
          be spoofed.?)

	allows resolvers to cache and utilize the authoritative child
	apex NS RRset in preference to the non-authoriative parent NS
	RRset. However, it is important to implement the steps described in
        <xref target="revalidation" format="default">Delegation Revalidation</xref> at
	the expiration of the parent's delegating TTL. Otherwise, the
	operator of a malicious child zone, originally delegated to, but
	subsequently delegated away from, can cause resolvers that refresh
	TTLs on subsequent NS set queries, or that pre-fetch NS queries, to
	never learn of the redelegated zone. This problem has been
	seen in the wild [include reference to Ghost Domains paper here].
